# Deployment Guide - Appointment Booking App

## üöÄ Deploy to Render.com (Free Hosting)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
1. Make sure all your changes are committed to Git
2. Ensure you have the following files in your project:
   - `requirements.txt` (for Python dependencies)
   - `render.yaml` (for deployment configuration)
   - `package.json` (for Node.js dependencies)

### Step 2: Deploy to Render.com

1. **Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)** and sign up/login

2. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your appointment-booking repository

3. **Deploy using the render.yaml file:**
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Click "Apply" to deploy both services

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - Backend will deploy first (Python service)
   - Frontend will deploy second (Static site)
   - Each service will get a unique URL

### Step 3: Get Your Shareable Links

After deployment, you'll get:
- **Frontend URL**: `https://appointment-booking-frontend.onrender.com`
- **Backend URL**: `https://appointment-booking-backend.onrender.com`

### Step 4: Share Your App

Share the frontend URL with anyone! They can:
- Book appointments without downloading anything
